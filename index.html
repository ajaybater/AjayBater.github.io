        <h2>Research Questions:</h2>
        <p>RQ1: Do maths communication videos have an effect on students’ maths anxiety?
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>RQ2: What features and properties (i.e. length, target audience, topic, format) of the videos have the greatest effect?
        </p>
        <p>RQ3: Do maths communication videos have an effect on the attitude and perception of maths within maths-adverse students?
        </p>
    </main>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Maths anxiety is a broad research topic that affects people of every age and demographic across the world. However, research into it has largely been focused on causes and effects of the disorder and few projects have explored potential treatments. Of which, from what I have identified, have largely focused on the benefit of informal in-person learning, (Thuneberg, Salmi, &amp; Fenyvesi, 2017; Vainikainen, Salmi, &amp; Thuneberg, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>If my research is successful, I hope it would provide insight into the potential of informal learning within online spaces, such as YouTube, in treating maths anxiety. I also aim to speculate on what type of videos and their qualities are most effective, if at all. I hope that maths institutions and communicators would find such results beneficial, or at the very least interesting!</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This will be structured as an intervention study composed of three stages: An initial questionnaire, exposure to the maths communication materials and concluding with the same questionnaire.
        </p>
        <p>The questionnaire will be composed of two sections. The Scale for Assessing Math Anxiety in Secondary-Education (SAMAS) and the Mathematics and Perceptions Survey (MAPS). Each have been developed and verifed by Yáñez-Marquina and Villardón-Gallego (2017), and Code et al., (2016) respectively.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The exposure to maths communication will consist of a variety of videos based around maths and its applications. The programme of videos will be delivered over the summer holidays, over a length of time to be determined. The videos will be sourced from various maths communicators and students from the University of Bath Maths Communication module.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 class="text-left">How you can help:</h2>
        <p><b>Maths communicators:</b>&nbsp;Please consider sharing video(s) and giving consent for them to be part of the study! Videos would ideally be between 5-20 minutes and should cover any topic related to maths and its applications. Videos of any difficulty and target audience are welcome, but may not contain explicit material; it is okay if they contain a minimal amount, that can be easily edited out. Please email me (contact below) to share your videos and discuss further details.</p>
        <p><b>Teachers:</b> Waiting for ethical approval!</p>

        <h5>Definitions</h5>
        <p><i>Maths Anxiety:</i> defined as “a feeling of tension and apprehension that interferes with maths performance ability, the manipulation of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life and academic situations” (Khasawneh, 2021). This study will take maths anxiety as a trait and umbrella term representing all theorised components such as statistics anxiety, numerical anxiety, maths test anxiety etc.
